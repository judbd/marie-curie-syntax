# marie-curie-syntax theme

Marie Curie is a colorful dark theme for Atom. The right balance between nice colors like you can find in Monokai-like themes and the physical integrity of your eyes in long coding sessions.

I recommend the use of the Dark-one UI, Fira Code font for ligature and an editor line height of 2rem.
